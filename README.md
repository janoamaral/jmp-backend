# Jano's music player

After many years using [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/your-media/) and [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)
I find those solutions very bloated and sometimes slow with thousands of files. So I
embark on making my very own streaming server and client.

### Roadmap

For this MVP I need to:

- [ ] Make audio streaming server
- [ ] Make simple frontend

Next steps

- [ ] Metadata management
- [ ] Basic library management
- [ ] Basic multiuser support
